Incorporating speech recognition into your Python application offers a level of interactivity and accessibility that few technologies can match.\n",

    "# <font color='blue'>How Speech Recognition Works</font>\n",
    ">Before we get to the nitty-gritty of doing speech recognition in Python, let’s take a moment to talk about how speech recognition works. A full discussion would fill a book, so I won’t bore you with all of the technical details here. In fact, this section is not pre-requisite to the rest of the tutorial. If you’d like to get straight to the point, then feel free to skip ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Speech recognition has its roots in research done at Bell Labs in the early 1950s. Early systems were limited to a single speaker and had limited vocabularies of about a dozen words. Modern speech recognition systems have come a long way since their ancient counterparts. They can recognize speech from multiple speakers and have enormous vocabularies in numerous languages.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The first component of speech recognition is, of course, speech. Speech must be converted from physical sound to an electrical signal with a microphone, and then to digital data with an analog-to-digital converter. Once digitized, several models can be used to transcribe the audio to text.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Most modern speech recognition systems rely on what is known as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This approach works on the assumption that a speech signal, when viewed on a short enough timescale (say, ten milliseconds), can be reasonably approximated as a stationary process—that is, a process in which statistical properties do not change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In a typical HMM, the speech signal is divided into 10-millisecond fragments. The power spectrum of each fragment, which is essentially a plot of the signal’s power as a function of frequency, is mapped to a vector of real numbers known as cepstral coefficients. The dimension of this vector is usually small—sometimes as low as 10, although more accurate systems may have dimension 32 or more. The final output of the HMM is a sequence of these vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    ">To decode the speech into text, groups of vectors are matched to one or more phonemes—a fundamental unit of speech. This calculation requires training, since the sound of a phoneme varies from speaker to speaker, and even varies from one utterance to another by the same speaker. A special algorithm is then applied to determine the most likely word (or words) that produce the given sequence of phonemes.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One can imagine that this whole process may be computationally expensive. In many modern speech recognition systems, neural networks are used to simplify the speech signal using techniques for feature transformation and dimensionality reduction before HMM recognition. Voice activity detectors (VADs) are also used to reduce an audio signal to only the portions that are likely to contain speech. This prevents the recognizer from wasting time analyzing unnecessary parts of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Fortunately, as a Python programmer, you don’t have to worry about any of this. A number of speech recognition services are available for use online through an API, and many of these services offer Python SDKs."

    "# <font color='blue'>Picking a Python Speech Recognition Package</font>\n",
    "A handful of packages for speech recognition exist on PyPI. A few of them include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    apiai\n",
    "*    assemblyai\n",
    "*    google-cloud-speech\n",
    "*    pocketsphinx\n",
    "*    SpeechRecognition\n",
    "*    watson-developer-cloud\n",
    "*    wit\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these packages—such as wit and apiai—offer built-in features, like natural language processing for identifying a speaker’s intent, which go beyond basic speech recognition. Others, like google-cloud-speech, focus solely on speech-to-text conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one package that stands out in terms of ease-of-use: SpeechRecognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing speech requires audio input, and SpeechRecognition makes retrieving this input really easy. Instead of having to build scripts for accessing microphones and processing audio files from scratch, SpeechRecognition will have you up and running in just a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SpeechRecognition library acts as a wrapper for several popular speech APIs and is thus extremely flexible. One of these—the Google Web Speech API—supports a default API key that is hard-coded into the SpeechRecognition library. That means you can get off your feet without having to sign up for a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility and ease-of-use of the SpeechRecognition package make it an excellent choice for any Python project. However, support for every feature of each API it wraps is not guaranteed. You will need to spend some time researching the available options to find out if SpeechRecognition will work in your particular case.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that you’re convinced you should try out SpeechRecognition, the next step is getting it installed in your environment."

    "\n",
    "The adjust_for_ambient_noise() method reads the first second of the file stream and calibrates the recognizer to the noise level of the audio. Hence, that portion of the stream is consumed before you call record() to capture the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can adjust the time-frame that adjust_for_ambient_noise() uses for analysis with the duration keyword argument. This argument takes a numerical value in seconds and is set to 1 by default. Try lowering this value to 0.5.\n",

    "Well, that got you “the” at the beginning of the phrase, but now you have some new issues! Sometimes it isn’t possible to remove the effect of the noise—the signal is just too noisy to be dealt with successfully. That’s the case with this file.\n",

    "If you find yourself running up against these issues frequently, you may have to resort to some pre-processing of the audio. This can be done with audio editing software or a Python package (such as SciPy) that can apply filters to the files. A detailed discussion of this is beyond the scope of this tutorial—check out Allen Downey’s Think DSP book if you are interested. For now, just be aware that ambient noise in an audio file can cause problems and must be addressed in order to maximize the accuracy of speech recognition.\n",

This method takes an audio source as its first argument and records input from the source until silence is detected.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> with mic as source:\n",
    "...     audio = r.listen(source)\n",
    "...\n",

    "```\n",
    "If the prompt never returns, your microphone is most likely picking up too much ambient noise. You can interrupt the process with +ctrl+c++ to get your prompt back.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle ambient noise, you’ll need to use the adjust_for_ambient_noise() method of the Recognizer class, just like you did when trying to make sense of the noisy audio file. Since input from a microphone is far less predictable than input from an audio file, it is a good idea to do this anytime you listen for microphone input.\n",

    "Recall that adjust_for_ambient_noise() analyzes the audio source for one second. If this seems too long to you, feel free to adjust this with the duration keyword argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SpeechRecognition documentation recommends using a duration no less than 0.5 seconds. In some cases, you may find that durations longer than the default of one second generate better results. The minimum value you need depends on the microphone’s ambient environment. Unfortunately, this information is typically unknown during development. In my experience, the default duration of one second is adequate for most applications.\n",
